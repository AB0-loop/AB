# AURUM BESPOKE - SECURE REPOSITORY UPDATE

## Repository Status: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED

The Aurum Bespoke project has been successfully updated with secure credential management and pushed to the GitHub repository.

## Repository Details

- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/AB0-loop/AB.git
- **Branch**: secure-main
- **Latest Commit**: cfdb678 - "Implement secure credential management with .env files..."

## Security Implementation

✅ **Secure Credential Management**:
- All sensitive credentials moved to `.env` files
- `.env` files added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- `.env.example` provided as template for new users
- Scripts updated to load credentials from environment variables
- GitHub security policies now satisfied

## Files Successfully Pushed

### Core Generation System
- [automation/generate_and_send_daily.py](file:///c:/Users/user/AB/automation/generate_and_send_daily.py) - Enhanced generation engine with FFmpeg support
- [automation/generate_content_pil_fallback.py](file:///c:/Users/user/AB/automation/generate_content_pil_fallback.py) - PIL fallback version for systems without FFmpeg

### Secure Configuration
- [automation/.env.example](file:///c:/Users/user/AB/automation/.env.example) - Template for environment variables
- [automation/.env](file:///c:/Users/user/AB/automation/.env) - NOT pushed to repository (in .gitignore for security)
- [.gitignore](file:///c:/Users/user/AB/.gitignore) - Updated to exclude .env files

## Deployment Instructions

### For GitHub Repository Access
1. Visit: https://github.com/AB0-loop/AB
2. Switch to the `secure-main` branch

### For Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AB0-loop/AB.git
   cd AB
   git checkout secure-main
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
     ```
     cp automation/.env.example automation/.env
     ```
   - Edit `automation/.env` and add your actual credentials

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r automation/requirements.txt
   ```

4. For full functionality (with FFmpeg):
   - Install FFmpeg and add to system PATH
   - Run: `python automation/generate_and_send_daily.py`

5. For immediate use (PIL fallback):
   - Run: `python automation/generate_content_pil_fallback.py`
   - Setup autonomous scheduling: `automation/setup_autonomous_scheduler.bat`

## System Verification

All system components have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Secure credential management with .env files
- ✅ Autonomous scheduling at 12:30 AM IST daily
- ✅ Differentiated content (image/video use different services)
- ✅ Disciplined generation with state management
- ✅ Dynamic video effects with posing characters
- ✅ Professional hashtag optimization for Bangalore
- ✅ Telegram integration ready
- ✅ PIL fallback for systems without FFmpeg

The system is ready for production use with secure credential management and exceeds all original requirements.
