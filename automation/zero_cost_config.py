ZERO COST CONFIGURATION FOR AURUM BESPOKE
=========================================

This configuration file provides settings for a completely zero-cost
implementation of the Aurum Bespoke content generation system.

Key Features:
- Reduced resolution settings (720p) to minimize processing requirements
- Cloud-based processing using free Render.com tier
- No GPU requirements through CPU-based processing
- Free AI services with fallbacks
- Optimized for free hosting platforms
